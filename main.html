  <h1 align="center">Welcome to Data Security</h1>
  <h2>What is Data Security????</h2>

  <p>Data Security refers to the process of protecting data from unauthorized access and data corruption throughout its lifecycle. Data security refers to data encryption, tokenization and key management practices that protect data across all applications and platforms.

 

Organizations around the globe are investing heavily in information technology (IT) cyber defense capabilities to protect their critical assets. Whether protecting a brand, intellectual capital, and customer information or providing controls for critical infrastructure, the means for incident detection and response to protect organizational interests have common elements: people, processes, and technology.</p>

<h2>Protecting Your Data Security and Data Privacy</h2>
<p>The first step in protecting your enterprise's data privacy and security is to identify the types of information you want to protect and where that information is exposed in your organization. Once you have completed your audit - identified your organization's priority information and determined your level of risk of data loss - the next step is to assess your applications and understand what areas of your application portfolio are leaving you vulnerable to external attacks.

According to a recent Gartner report, the market for content-aware data loss prevention solutions continues to grow at more than 20 percent year over year. Yet the report also notes that many organizations are struggling to establish appropriate data protection policies and procedures for mobile devices as they interact with sensitive corporate data.</p>
<h2>Effectiveness of Traditional Data Security and Data Privacy Products</h2>
<ul>
<li>
    Accuracy of data loss prevention content analysis engines. Content analysis methods range from keyword searching, regular expressions handling and document fingerprint matching. Like any other analysis engine, lowering the false-positive and false-negative rates are important to improve the solution's accuracy.</li>
    <li>Scalability of data security solutions. As network traffic and employee use of multiple types of data grow, established data protection solutions must scale to keep up with organizational usage.</li>
    <li>Sophistication of the data security policy definition and process management capabilities. Organizations typically have multiple policies for different types of data and multiple processes to manage data and respond to data loss related events. The ability to automate policy enforcement in people- and process-centric situations is important.</li>
